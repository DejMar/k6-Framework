# k6 Framework Starter

This repository provides a structured starting point for organizing k6 performance tests with reusable configuration, reporting, and helper utilities.

## Project Structure

- `tests/`: Individual k6 test entry points (`smoke-test.js`).
- `scripts/lib/`: Shared helpers such as configuration loaders and summary reporters.
- `config/`: JSON configuration for scenarios, thresholds, and summary output paths.
- `data/results/`: JSON summaries or other run artifacts generated by k6.
- `reports/`: Human-readable HTML reports generated after a run.
- `logs/`: Reserved for execution logs or artifacts you want to keep per run.
- `grafana/`: Place Grafana dashboards or provisioning files if you wire tests to observability.

## Prerequisites

- [k6](https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/installation/) installed locally (`brew install k6`).

## Running the Sample Smoke Test

```bash
cd "/Users/dejanmarjanovic/Desktop/Automation Projects/k6-Framework"
k6 run tests/smoke-test.js
```

### Optional Environment Overrides

- `BASE_URL`: Target a different host without editing configuration.
- `SLEEP_INTERVAL`: Seconds to wait between iterations (defaults to `1`).
- `K6_ENV`: Annotates the test run with the target environment (e.g., `staging`, `prod`).

Example:

```bash
BASE_URL=https://my.api.example SLEEP_INTERVAL=2 K6_ENV=staging \
  k6 run tests/smoke-test.js
```

## Outputs

After a run, k6 will:

- Print a colorized summary to the terminal.
- Save the raw summary to `data/results/smoke-summary.json`.
- Generate an HTML report at `reports/smoke-summary.html` (leveraging [k6-reporter](https://github.com/benc-uk/k6-reporter)).

## Next Steps

- Add additional scenarios under `tests/` and reference shared helpers.
- Extend `config/default.json` or create environment-specific config files.
- Version control Grafana dashboards or scripts under `grafana/` as you integrate monitoring.
